I am a second year PhD student at the department of Computer Science at the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/). I am advised by [Prof. Gennady Pekhimenko](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~pekhimenko/). I primarily focus on the area of systems research. My research interests include stream processing, systems for machine learning, and distributed/parallel computing.

Before joining University of Toronto, I graduated with MSc in Computer Science from [University of British Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) under the supervision of [Prof. Alexandra Fedorova](https://www.ece.ubc.ca/~sasha/) and [Prof. Ivan Beschastnikh](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/). Before that, I obtained B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from [National Institute of Technology Calicut](https://minerva.nitc.ac.in/).
